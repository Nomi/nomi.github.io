<!-- <p style="text-align: center;"></p> -->
I'm passionate about Programming, Game Development, Creative Writing (mostly poetry), all the general Computer Science concepts I've had the privelege of learning about, and of course, a little bit of Maths. Mostly the Discrete kind.
I prefer music, games, anime, and manga for entertainment.

## About this blog   
I haven't made any concrete plans yet, but I think I'd like to use this blog to showcase my portfolio, personal projects, give updates about my projects and life, collect fun and usefull knowledge, write about things I feel passionate about, and so on and so forth. 
I mostly made this blog as way to get used to Markdown and Jekyll, as this knowledge will be useful for documentation for future projects. I have some projects in the making and I hope that I'll be able to use this know-how for better documentation on those. I'll probably have links to the project websites for each project here as well.
